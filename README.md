# Five-Letters


## Introduction


This game is called "Five Letters". I get the idea from playing a game called "Wordle". If you are interested in how to play this game, here is a short instruction.


HOW TO PLAY

- Guess the word in six tries.

- Each guess must be a valid five-letter word. Hit the enter button to submit.

- After each guess, the color of the boxs will change to show how close your guess was to the word.

The letter P is in the word and in the correct spot.
